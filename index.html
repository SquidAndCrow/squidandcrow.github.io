        <h1>The Story So Far</h1>
        <p>The Funky Bunch arrived in Bagnan in search of Prince Franz' precious family necklace. They paid for rooms at the Randy Giraffe and began their search.</p>
        <p>Sheila, who had stolen Prince Franz' necklace made haste to a the Rusty Copper—a pawn shop owned by Keeva—and convinced her to hold onto the necklace with the promise that she would be given a portion of its eventual sale. She agreed.</p>
        <p>During this, the rest of the party met Loranna, a scribe, and attempted to hire her to make some Lost Necklace posters for Prince Franz. Her door was locked, but that was no match for the Funky Bunch who broke in anyway. They saw that Loranna was performing forgery services for none other than Steve the Crime Boss.</p>
        <p>They were given a price (that no one could afford since everyone's broke as fuck), and separated to look around the city for more information.</p>
        <p>Liliana spoke with Barto, the owner of the Randy Giraffe, and he offered her enough money to pay for the Lost Necklace posters if she would get herself hired at the rival tavern, The Snuggly Ostritch, and sing a song promoting the Randy Giraffe. She agreed, returned with a writ of performance from Captain Sven, and prepared to go on stage that night.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the party found their way to the Rusty Copper in search of the necklace. Feeling the heat, Sheila changed the deal with Keeva, telling her to immediately pawn the necklace to Prince Franz. Having been told of its value, and knowing she now had a prince over a barrel, she offered the necklace to the party for 10,000 gold pieces.</p>
        <p>The party negotiated, and Keeva gave them an opportunity to retreive a ledger containing evidence of Steve the Crime Lord's misdeeds in the possession of Lord Marsten. The party agreed that they would take this course of action.</p>
        <p>Liliana, Sheila and Marky Mark came up with an executed a plan to get Captain Sven out of the picture during Liliana's song, knowing that the bar owner would never let the party out alive after the kind of song she had planned. Marky Mark would charm his way into the Snuggly Ostritch's chef's pants giving Sheila an opportunity to dose Captain Sven's dinner with sleeping poison</p>
        <p>Madonna and Prince Franz said "fuck it" and broke into the Rusty Copper that night and stole the necklace back while Liliana performed .</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The plan worked, and with Sven knocked out Liliana performed her advertisement for the Randy Giraffe. The crowd turned on her quickly, throwing beer steins, chairs, glitter bombs, and anything else they could. With the protective forcefield around the stage failing, she cashed in her favor with Sheila giving the rogue a passionate kiss winning the crowd back. Liliana caught sight of Loranna rushing clumsily out of the tavern.</p>
        <p>Prince Franz, Madonna and Marky Mark were hanging out near the entrance of the Snuggly Ostritch when Loranna came out and asked Marky Mark to escort her through the streets of Bagnan to her home in the residential district. He agreed and the two left; followed "deftly" behind by everyone else in the party, convinced that Marky Mark was up to some skeez.</p>
        <p>After winding Marky Mark through the city in the hopes that he wouldn't remember how to get to his house, she offered him a drink back at her place only to have Liliana rush up and start fangirling Loranna giving Sheila the opportunity to knock out and kidnap Loranna to use her as leverage against Steve the Crime Boss</p>
        <p>Understandably pissed off at the group, Marky Mark hefted Loranna over his shoulder and ran her back through the city away from the group, but right into an ambush of Steve the Crime Boss' men. Marky Mark dispatched one of them, but was so distracted by the ambush, that Madonna snuck in and picked up Loranna's unconscious body whisking her away from the fight. The rest of the party caught up to Marky Mark, and Prince Franz landed a savage blow on the remaining rogue, but not before he blew a signal whistle alerting the entire area that something was wrong.</p>
        <p>As Madonna rushed through the city streets as guided by her owl, Loranna whispered to her "Please help me, you have to get me away from Steve the Crime Lord". Madonna lead Loranna out of the city to a waterfall grotto, then sent her owl back with a note for the party letting them know where she was going to be.</p>
        <p>The party left at in the alley with the dead thugs scattered, except for Marky Mark who was determined to get something out of the night's adventure. As he looted the corpses, five thieves came out of the shadows and surrounded him. Marky Mark summoned some good vibrations and dispatched all five enemies by hurling blades into their foreheads. After a quick loot, Marky Mark ran, catching up with the rest of the party who'd regrouped at the Randy Giraffe where they received Madonna's note.</p>
        <p>Barto told the group that he'd cover for them as they escaped, knowing that the Festering Scar would be on them if they waited around. The party Bagnon, and met up with Madonna and Loranna where Loranna told them that Steve the Crime Boss was forcing her and her sister Keeva to perform underhanded services for the crime syndicate using their parents lives as leverage. The party now has a decision to make whether or not they want to help the scribe and her family, or get the hell out of the area.</p>
        <p>Oh, and Marky Mark's penis has been massively erect for at least four hours</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The group conversed with Loranna, and she convinced them to save her family while she waited at the grotto. Marky Mark earned a new verse by quieting his erection on a nearby, mossy tree.</p>
        <p>In order to reenter the town, Madonna suggested that the group contact her friend Dexter: a seamstress who lives on the outskirts of Bagnan. Dexter was delighted that Madonna was finally willing to let him dress her, even if it was in peasant clothes. The group planned to enter the town as textile sellers wearing the peasant sarapes Dexter prepared.</p>
        <p>As they entered the town, they saw a band of well-oiled strapping young men lead by Captain Sven of the Snuggly Ostritch rushing directly to the Randy Giraffe. The band of Glitter Boys split up and began nailing all of the tavern's entrances shut. The Funky Bunch ran to the rear and dispatched the gang, but not before Captain Sven ordered flaming bombs be thrown into the Randy Giraffe.</p>
        <p>Marky Mark rushed dick first into the back door and Sheila made her way in to save the trapped patrons. She's able to convince Barto to leave his office, but while he was distracted she grabbed proof that Barto didn't even own the bar in the first place!.</p>
        <p>Barto escapes the bar, and presents the group with a bottle of La Virgen Roja, an amazingly well-crafted and respected run from the Virgen Islands and heads off, while Sven and the Glitter Boys return to the Ostritch. The party did not walk away completely unscathed though: Prince Franz has suffered what is apparently a mortal wound.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>The Funky Bunch surveyed the city, and saw that the commons were being ransacked by the Festering Scar. Sheila noticed that their efforts, while seemingly random and chaotic, were actually clever ruses to allow for the Scar to focus getting their people into their buildings and smuggling criminal stuff out</p>
  <p>The party didn't hesitate, and wanting to both rescue Loranna's family and collect some dirt on Steve the Crime boss, they split up: Sheila and Franz headed toward Lord Marsten's manor, while Lilianna, Madonna and Marky Mark made their way toward Loranna's home.</p>
  <p>Sheila was able to help she and Franz get past the city guard blockades, and when that failed, Franz was able to use his nobility and charm to convince the guards that they were guests of Lord Marsten and they had an appointment to see him. The guards granted them access to the noble quarter without further delay.</p>
  <p>Marky Mark, Lilianna and Madonna fought their way toward Loranna's home. Madonna shot two of them deftly, while Liliana sang the ballad of Marky Mark to bolster his strength. Marky Mark snapped the neck of one of the rogues, but not before he was able to bury a blade into Lilianna's shoulder. Enraged, Marky Mark lept at the thief, crotch-to-face, and snapped his neck between two powerful thighs. Madonna dispatched the third brgand and they were left to enter Loranna's home, finding the music box they'll be using to convince Keeva and her parents that the Funky Bunch is to be trusted.</p>
  <p>Franz and Sheila had less luck. After failing to convince Lord Marsten's butler that they have business with Lord Marsten, the pair break into the manor via first floor window, situated directly above the Marsten matriarch's urn and ashes. Having shattered both the urn and table the urn was resting on by stumbling through the window, they were confronted by a maid and butler very displeased to see them.</p>
  <p>The pair discovered Lord Marsten only hires former martial artists, and their attempts to attack the waitstaff left them disarmed and disadvantaged. Prince Franz was having nothing of this, and stood against Sheila in support of the peasants. Thinking quickly, Sheila recalled that Lord Marsten treats his staff like garbage, and was able to convince the staff to let them gain access to the house after convincing the maid and butler that she and Franz were starting a people's revolution; uncovering corrupution and bringing the rich to justice using Barto's forged deed as leverage.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Meanwhile, under the supportive song of Liliana, accompanied by the sensual dance of a naked Madonna, Marky Mark busts down Loranna's door and the group enters. Liliana takes the time to dig through Loranna's papers and finds dirt on Lord Marsten revealing him to have a brute squad who seduce the gay community and then assault them (The Family Value Militia, AKA the Gayschtoppo). In addition, Loranna kept documents revealing that massive homophobe Lord Marsten has a secret life as the super fabulous Mike Hot-Pence. The group finds a secret door leading to an underground tunnel and descend just as members of the Festering Scar crash into Loranna's house.</p>
  <p>In Marston's Manor, Prince Franz and Sheila search through Marsten's study looking for and finding Steve the Crime Boss' ledger. The ledger holds details of Steve the Crime Boss shorting and grifting his fellow criminals. In addition, as a token of his esteem, Sheila finds a chromed bust of Lord Marsten and fashions it into a gaudy amulet perfect for Prince Franz. Franz on the other hand, is not satisfied with the ledger, or the amulet and insists on continuing his search for Lord Marston's brooch collection.</p>
  <p>The pair enter his quarters, and while Franz is searching Marsten's closet, a young maid enters the bedroom and sees them lurking around. Sheila's attempts to win the maid over fails as the maid's family has been in service to the Marsten family for years, and the maid initiates a complete lockdown of the house. Not interested in any further diplomacy, Prince Franz uses the gifted amulet to bludgeon the fuck out of the maid before heading out. The pair leave with ledger and brooch in hand, covered in maid brains.</p>
  <p>Prince Franz and Sheila escape the manor and the area, and head toward Keeva's home. The tunnels beneath Loranna's home also leads Liliana, Madonna, and Marky Mark to Keeva's home as well. Having found each other, the party begins the search for Keeva and her family</p>
  <hr>
  <p>At Keeva's Prince Franz and Madonna take advantage of Keeva's bathing basin while Marky Mark defends the Festering Scar members rushing through the tunnels in pursuit. Marky Mark hurled a molotov cocktail cutting two rogues off, but left an opening for the third rogue to stab him in the ass. MM pulled the rogue up into Keeva's as Franz pushed a couch over the trap door. Though the assassin was enraged, Madonna offered her bosoms to comfort him, and he collapsed into them, weeping. She offered him lavendar tea laced with a poison from Sheila to make him pliable and he tells them everything.</p>
  <p>He says that Keeva is in the sewers, and that they tend to be angry; calling it "The Perfect Shitstorm". While the rogue is being spooned by Marky Mark, Sheila finds out that the only way Keeva would be released is if Loranna is brought back, and discovered some information about those guarding the sewer entrance.</p>
  <p>The group decides that they will act as if Sheila is their prisoner, and they're turning her over to get into Steve the Crime Boss' good graces. They left the assassin to sleep, but not before collecting his Festering Scar insignia (a wrought-iron cloak clasp in the shape of a scarred mask).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <h2>Party Reaches Level 2!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sheila learns how to apply poison more effectively and gains Charisma. Additionally, she and Prince Franz have resolved the stolen item bond while forming a new bond with Liliana</li>
    <li>Franz' reputation for destruction can now impact subordinates of crushed foes. The prince bolstered his Charisma</li>
    <li>Liliana has learned to be more effectively while healing and focused on her Wisdom</li>
    <li>Marky Mark continues to master dick-fu, becoming more deadly to attackers. He has grown stronger, and has gained some sympathy from Madonna</li>
    <li>Madonna has learned to hide herself in natural surroundings, and has become more intelligent</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The Funky Bunch was advised to seek out Sander, a Festering Scar guard protecting the entrance to the sewers. He was to be the point of contact for the group to turn over Sheila in an attempt to get into Scar territory. The only contact being made though was Marky Mark's sword cutting him from right shoulder to left temple when attempts to palaver failed.</p>
<p>Madonna wildly thrust her bosoms at the remaining Scar guard attempting an ancient ranger grappling technique, but ended up getting clipped and bloodied. Encouraged by the heartening song of Liliana, Prince Franz stepped toward the brigand and cut him in half, from scrotum to scalp.</p>
<p>Marky Mark, took a trophy by severing what little flesh that held Sander's upper torso to the rest of his body, and is now dragging Sander's head and shoulders by the hand. Franz examined the body of the cleft guard, and discovers that he is the custodian of the sewers, the poo talker, two weeks from retiring, full pension and 401k funded, and now very dead on the streets of Bagnan. Franz took the custodian's keys as well as a sparkly button denoting the former poo talker's station. He also recalled that there is some discord amongst the Festering Scar: not everyone is on board with Steve the Crime Bosses' recent advances on Lord Marsten.</p>
<p>The Bunch enters the sewers, and Madonna quickly senses an intelligence somewhere in the depths. Liliana gets caught staring at Madonna's boobs, and quickly quips that she was just worried about the wound she has taken. Liliana then began singing to Madonna's breasts while massaging them for "healing reasons" which is totally a bard thing. The song was successful, but attracted the attention of the sewer intelligence: the fecal hivemind.</p>
<p>Madonna sensed a coalescing of poop slimes which began speaking in a language only Madonna knew, the fart language (blame Becky). She was able to convince the hivemind that the Funky Bunch only wanted to collect Keeva and be on their way. The grand poohbah (thanks Marella) offered a deal to the group: kill any Festering Scar here, and the sewers will guide them to Keeva safely. Madonna reports that the poo really just wants to be left alone, and all of the Scar activity has upset the sewer.</p>
<p>The group continues on through the sewers, sludge pools leading them deeper into darkness.</p>
<p>Oh, and Liliana sung a song to heal Marky Mark's butt wound, but for some reason didn't have a need to massage him. Seems...suspicious</p>
<hr>
<p>The filth elemental leads the funky bunch to a room filled with unsuspecting Scar. Liliana began a beautiful song to strengthen the group, and while successful, the Scar on the other side barricade the door to prevent unwanted interruption. Franz thinks cleverly, though. Knowing that shit patrol is a lonely one, he offers up a sexy dance from naked Madonna. It works, and they open the door, but quickly realize it is a trap after Franz threatens them directly, believing this is all a test from Steve.</p>

<p>But, Franz realizes that he has become the custodian of the sewers and has the keys to prove it, at least after Sheila pointed it out. Liliana surmises the correct key and the group bursts into the room to find a disturbed poker game, and four very annoyed Scar guards. Franz points at Karl, the cheating rotten bastard Scar guard, and tells the rest of the guards that Karl is hiding Aces!</p>

<p>Karl, not willing to let a 10 silver pot go to the honest winner, stabs and kills his best friend Friendo. Marky Mark rushes into the party, but stumbles over Franz's noble feet and gets hurt in the pride parts and leaves in a huff. Madonna kicks Eugene, another of the guards, squarely in the junk, but realizes too late that he was a eunuch and the blow wasn't nearly as effective as hoped. Liliana takes aim and squarely puts an arrow where Madonna's foot was just moments before.</p>

<p>Karl takes another stab at his former friends, but misses, allowing fellow guard Steven to feint and nick Karl's femoral artery. Madonna puts another arrow into Eugene and the eunuch isn't looking too good.</p>

<p>Sheila walks up to Steven, and successfully applies a needle full of Goldenroot to convince him that they're all on the same side. It works, and Steven allows the group to gain access to the deeper tunnels. Franz looks again at the table, and reveals that Karl was actually just holding a 4, and not an Ace. Marky Mark wants to gimp the eunuch, but the warrior's pride convinces him to just finish the man's life. MM slits Eugene's throat and pulls his soul into his body (or at least he thinks it's Eugene's soul).</p>
<hr>
<p>Liliana digs through the bodies and finds a handful of coin as well as a peasant wedding ring which she give to Franz. Marky Mark, ready for action, shoulders his way through the northern door revealing a room with a stone obelisk adorned with runes and pretty stones that seems to be cleansing the area of sludge. Madonna blinked in and out of visibility and approached the oblelisk ignoring and dodging Liliana's attempts to stop her. Liliana recalled a story about a former companion, a dwarf named Mick the Knife, who ignored a magical ward on a treasure chest resulting in the dwarf shrinking down to two inches tall upon opening it.</p>

<p>Sheila believes her study of the runes will result in the ability to craft a poison that will also cause shrinkage, but she is very, very wrong. MM, tired again from the hemming and hawing of not destroying things moves to push the obelisk down, but it is too firmly attached to the ground to budge. The last remaining Scar guard Steven parleys release from the party, and the angered Marky Mark convinces Steven that the fastest way out is actually to go deeper into the sewer. Steven claps MM on the shoulder as he thanks him for the advice. As Steve steps into the next room, the flagstone collapses completely and he falls to a very pointy death on spikes below, splattering Madonna with blood. Franz suggests using the bodies of the other Scar guards to clog the trap and proceed. Sheila suggests using a rope, but Franz will have none of it (until Liliana suggests the same thing). Sheila ties a rope around her waist and leaps over the pit. Her jump is just short though, and she lands ribs first on the opposite side. Sheila uses some found wooden planks to fashion a bridge for the rest of the group.</p>

<p>Madonna listens intently, and begins to hear music emanating from rubble in the eastern wall. MM begins hauling stone to make a path after Sheila gives a quick check for traps. As MM creates a way through, the music becomes louder and clearer. Liliana smells a rush of stale, dead air. Madonna sends in her owl, and the music stops. The owl does not return. Sheila squeezes through, but her hand catches a loose stone sending her lamp crashing to the ground, but she is compelled to continue toward the music. Liliana now recognizes the music as the songs damned spirits unable to pay the ferryman must play while begging for coins to cross over into the afterlife. Franz pushes through, and finds himself humming along with the tune.</p>

<p>MM clears more rubble making it easier for the rest of the group to get through the tunnel. Liliana makes it through the with the lamp and finds several spirits busking, and while they are weakened from possibly centuries of being trapped on the mortal plane they are growing hungry and enraged. Liliana confirms that the spirits are in need of 32 pieces of silver, 2 each, in order to pass on. Sheila provides the coin if they perform the service of clearing the tunnel of all remaining Scar. They agree, and with evil grins the spectres turn into horrifying creatures: like the eyeball hands guy from Pan's Labrynth crossed with Edward Penis-hands, with a vertical vagina mouth (Damon).</p>

<p>Ghosts rush out, and split the party. Everywhere the spirits encounter Scar, they tear them apart with ease. The paths of the sewer tunnels converge and the party sees the ghosts attacking the final Scar members, including Keeva...</p>

<hr>


<p>As Madonna's Owl returns for her, the Funky Bunch assesses the room. The spectres make short work of the Scar, save for two: a regular Scar rogue and something far more capable. Marky Mark recognizes the fighting style and rushes in to fight him. Meanwhile, Liliana successfully convinces the spectres nearing Keeva that the captive pawnbroker is with them using Keeva's music box. The ghost leaves for easier prey as Marky Mark attacks Scottie Gee, a revived, undead Scar minion still holding MM's thrown dagger in his forehead. The group now believes MM's story of killing off five guards with one deadly series of thrown blades. Sheila convinces Madonna to distract the keys to Keeva's cell from the remaining living Scar rogue with a sexy dance, but he is uninterested.</p>

<p>Franz needs no keys, and shatters the bars of Keeva's cell with his bare hands. Keeva is freed, but not looking well. Liliana tends to her with food and water.</p>


<p>Sheila surmises that the man who "puts the romance in necromancy" has had a hand in raising Scar Lieutenant Scottie G. She also realizes that fire and decapitation will kill him, so she tells Franz to torch the rogue while Marky Mark keeps him busy. Franz tosses a torch at Scottie G, and it lands squarely in his chest. Unfortunately, this leaves Franz open to Scottie G's retaliation and the undead rogue pulls the dagger from his own forehead, wound gushing black goo, and shoves it into Franz' shoulder. IT'S A BIG OWIE</p>

<p>MM shouts, "You killed Franz you medieval dickweed!" as he charges him and cleanly cuts Scottie G's head off. Not knowing his own strength, the blow forces MM to collide with the enflamed zombie and he takes some surface damage as the rogue's head splatters against the opposite wall and its corpse collapses to the stone floor.</p>

<p>Liliana sings a healing song, and Madonna succeds in helping Franz by sucking the poison from his wound. She spits it into a vial of Sheila's for future research, but Liliana's aware that the goo is slowing her healing ability. MM takes the dagger that Scottie G pulled from his forhead and runs from the room. Believing that the obelisk can cleanse it, MM shatters the obelisk with the dagger. The dagger is clean, but MM suffers a grevious wound as a curse shrinking his manhood to near-mortal size lands upon him.</p>

<p>The rest of the party hears a soul shattering, "NOOOOOOO, I BLAME THIS ON MY FATHER." Liliana rushes in to see MM curled up in a fetal position sucking his thumb, but not before MM can shove a wang-shaped piece of obelisk down his pants to hide his shame. Liliana know something's up and questions why MM broke the obelist. MM just plays it off, and Liliana does a tap test on MM's tumescence. MM cuts his palm and bleeds on his once majestic phallus saying, "I will avenge you".</p>

<p>Sheila, feeling bad for Franz' burn tells him that she owes him one. "One what?" Franz responds, then asks to be carried out of the sewer, a task Sheila is unable to perform.</p>

<p>Madonna, tired of being underground in a disgusting sewer says let's get the fuck out of here, and she farts her way out of the sewer, fulfilling her obligation to the filth elementals. MM picks up the semi-precious stones from the obelisk; a pale reward considering his sacrifice</p>

<p>The group exit the sewers to see the city in utter bedlam, even the guards they've killed to get into the sewer haven't been moved. Franz returns the custodians keys by shoving it into his corpse and pushing the cleft body back together. Franz is in no condition to fight, and Sheila suggests that she and Liliana meet at Keeva's parent's house to complete the mission while the rest return to Madonna's grotto</p>

<p>Keeva tells the group that her nickname is Kiki and write a note to her parents to prove the group's intent, Madonna tells Sheila and Liliana how to get to their home, and Sheila plots a path to get them there. They slip past a pair of otherwise engaged city guards, and jimmy open a back window to enter the home of Doctor Faucet and Sylvia.</p>

<p>The pair interrupt what the parents belived to be their last chance for some sexy time, but Liliana is able to convince them that their daughters sent them along. Sheila grabs a sex whip, and Liliana finds a rhinestone collar for Franz.</p>

<p>Madonna uses her camouflage to get the group out of the city with her owl's help. MM wants to try fucking his way through the city witho only half a dick, but causes more of a distraction than anything else. Franz is totally quiet, nursing his wounds, giving Madonna the opportunity to lead the group to the city gates. They're almost out when they spy Yancy AKA DJ-T, another undead Scar leiutenant there with two additional Scar members: Bill and The Fish</p>

<p>MM rushes forward, and leaps toward the Fish completely shoving both of his feet into the Fish' torso and wearing him like a belt. He decapitates Yancy, and the undead's head flies into Bill knocks him out. MM dumps the bloody hula hoop, grabs the dagger, and the group is able to escape</p>

<p>Everyone returns to the grotto and Bagnan is in shambles</p>

  <h3>Tales from Barbarea</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold">What is Prince Franz' favorite festival back in Barbarea</p>
  <p>Prince Franz' favorite festival is Unboxing Day, when everyone Franz encounters must give him gifts. He keeps the pretty and sparkly stuff, and gives peasants items that he doesn't want.</p>
  <p>This happens every few weeks, and if the present is crap the giver is banished from Barbarea</p>
  <p>Throughout that day, only food that comes in boxes, like mac n' cheese, can be eaten as it is meant to be a very carb-heavy day</p>
  <p>The worst present Franz ever received was an IOU. Just a piece of paper that said that. No one ever says what. The family Kar-ian (Kardashian) was banished as a result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the group returns to the grotto, Liliana and Sheila have a conversation regarding the ghosts Sheila paid the passage of. Appreciative, Liliana relieves Sheila of the favor owed, and thereafter Sheila and Liliana will be equal partners in crime.</p>

<p>As the group returns, Loranna rushes to embrace her sister and parents (Dr. Faucet and Sylvia), and doesn't seem the slightest bit disturbed by her parents lack of clothing. Loranna inspects Franz' wound and determines that he's been affected by a magical toxin that she is unable to help here. Dr. Faucet also examines the wound, and luckily for the group, he spends his free time studying up on necromancy. Dr. Faucet determines that the wound is a result of a necromancer's magic infecting the ichor that covered the blade that Franz was wounded by. Dr. Faucet is able to make a poultice from river algae that keeps the wound from worsening; at least for the time being.</p>

<p>Sheila takes some time to examine the poison that she'd collected and is able to procure a single dose that will deal additional necrotic damage to whomever is wounded by it. Sheila offers to clean Marky Mark's blade for him, but he's too traumatized by something to take note of the innuendo. Sheila is able to collect an additional dose, but drops the blade into the grotto's water washing away any remaining toxin.</p>

<p>It is early afternoon, overcast, and the middle of a cold Autumn</p>Liliana and Madonna discuss which city to travel to, and they decide on Dark Tower: a city built around a large black tower because with a landmark like that it's pretty silly to call it anything else. Liliana recalls that the people in Dark Tower don't speak or even acknowledge the tower's existence. The people of the port city make their money through standard trade and commerce. As a city slightly more affluent than Bagnan, it will have ample accomodations for travellers and medical facilities. There is one school there, a school that is very difficult to get into, and those who do not attend know very little about it. It's for the elite, and a shadowy group of politically inclined individuals is connected to it.</p>

<p>Madonna has heard that the whole town is haunted, and her Owl Mahonna is scared to go there. Sheila has been to Dark Tower and attempted to sell some "acquired" goods there, but was generally rebuffed as citizens from Dark Tower look down on the poor folks of Bagnan. Realizing they'll need a cover, they decide to pose as travellers from the Virgin Isles, Madonna's homeland. Madonna tells the group that the Virgin Isles are beautiful, very warm, and people have little need for clothing. There is a wide variety of animals, and it is a generally friendly area though in recent times they've had problems with pirates and other rogues from neighboring regions come and attempt to steal resources</p>

<p>The party and the Faucet family agree to the cover. Prince Franz does not, as he is a prince of Barbarea and has no fear that he will be mistaken for Bagnan trash. Franz offers to adopt Sylvia as mom number two, and she lets them know that she was a seamstress in town offering to mend their clothing before travelling.</p>

<p>To prepare for the journey, Madonna and Franz go hunting while Marky Mark looks off into the distant horizon brooding, nay mourning, his loss.</p>

<p>Madonna finds a number of Pignut Hickory trees and is able to collect several pounds of nuts which will provide the Faucet family with half of their necessary rations for the trip. Mohanna flies around and finds a wild plum tree that Franz decides to shake the fuck out of. He ends up reopening his wound and they collect a small amount of the fruit. Franz tells Madonna that she is like his best friend, but that he's not interested in her girly parts.</p>

<p>Liliana attempts to talk to Marky Mark about his fallen soldier, but he walks off in the distance to the Incredible Hulk ending credits theme music.</p>

<p>On the journey, Madonna will trailblaze, Liliana will quartermaster, and Sheila will scout.</p>

  <h3>Tales from Barbarea</h3>
  <p style="font-weight: bold">What is Taboo in Barbarea?</p>
  <p>You never ever ever pet the cats with your left hand. If it's on the left-hand side, you have to wrap around and do it with your right. In the before time, when cats were big meow-mewos in the cave, when the first Barbareans went to pet them, they bit off their left arm. Punishment is the removal of the left arm, then they realized it was bad on commerce. Now, you have to put cat food on your arm and let them nibble it to ward off bad luck.</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>Sheila is scouting ahead, and is ambushed by 4 rogues armed with crossbows. To gain their confidence, she speaks to the man with the blue bandana wrapped around his arm. As it turns out, this man is the group's newest member, the bandana noting who can be left behind or killed if the rest of the group needs an exit. One of the rogues, a woman offended by the affront, slaps Sheila and demands money or her life.</p>

  <p>The rest of the group is travelling a few minutes behind, the path Madonna is guiding them on is full of tress with lots of palces to hide. While still a road, it's fallen into disuse and is rarely travelled. Mohonna is flying above, but the overcast morning is making it difficult for the bird to be too helpful. Marky Mark's average penis points the group toward adventure as they come upon Sheila and four rogues training weapons on her. Franz, upset and frustrated being surrounded by dirt wastes no time demanding to know what the rogues are doing.</p>

  <p>Sheila pretends that she doesn't know the group, but Franz' constant winking during Sheila's palaver causes the lead rogue to become more suspicious. MM knows shit's about to go down and he hurls his sword into the rogue moving to flank the party. It embeds itself into the bandit's arm causing him to drop his crossbow; MM is on him as the blade lands and daggers-in-hand uses the man as a human shield. Wait, wait, the bard has a song. Liliana begins singing to focus Madonna's attacks. Madonna fires, hitting another flanking rogue in his off-hand; after the shot lands, Madonna fades into the shrubbery. Sheila coats her dagger with Oil of Tagget in an entirely unseen gesture. Franz rushes in to shield Sheila from the remaining rogues as the smell of chamomile and vaporub fills the air as Sheila's poison-coated dagger scrapes against the lead rogue's forearm dropping her. Sheila's brash manuever opened her up to attack though, and she takes a crossbow bolt to the arm. Liliana ceases her song long enough to fire an arrow into Madonna's target, but she flinches and the arrow grazes Franz' left butt cheek.</p>

  <p>Marky Mark laughs so hard he loses focus, and the rogue he was grappling breaks free. Not laughing any more, MM straight up decapitates the rogue uttering "Don't make me laugh" to Liliana. Madonna rushes out of the forest with the fury of a thousands suns, and scares the shit out of the remaining rogues causing them to surrender.</p>

  <p>Everyone but Marky Mark gets a crossbow. The group also finds a ring bearing the Masten family crest on the lead roguve. Franz presents his butt for healing, and Liliana attempts a soothing song, but the shouts of "FIX MY BUTT" alert bandit reinforcements and to the sounds of a rallying horn, MM decapitates the injured rogue while the uninjured one escapes. The group heads into the forest with the lead rogue bound. </p>

  <p>Madonna leads the group out of danger and Franz relays the event to the Faucet family. He states, "As the group was frolicking through the forest, Sheila was doing whatever she wanted when a band of rogues started being mean to her. Then Liliana shot me in the butt. Then their heads fell off and we got the fuck out of there."</p>

  <p>In a safe spot, Dr. Faucet removes Franz' arrow, but can not heal it. Sheila goes off to have some private time with MM, and MM follows. She wants to play good cop/bad cop with the rogue they've taken captive. Sheila slaps the rogue across the face to wake her. MM wants to take a different approach but putting the rogue's hand in a bowl of water while she sleeps. But, MM has no water. Franz offers to pee into a bowl, but they realize they have no bowl. Though, the group finds it suspicious that MM won't pee in front of them.</p>

  <p>The group finds out that the captive bandit's name is Burga. When asked about Marsten, with a sinister grin she says "He took the wrong road home." She's cold. You could say she's an Ice Burga (why did I record that (and why did I put it in the summary?!)). Liliana doesn't believe her story about Masten, but Burga is able to convince her that they were training with their shiny new crossbows when Sheila stumbled upon them. MM's good cop routine reveals that Marsten and his travelling party were ambushed and that he's still alive at their camp.</p>

  <p>Burga reveals that she's a patrol leader, and can lead small groups of bandits into road attacks. The group believes Burga may be useful as a bargaining ship with the rest of the bandit party. Unconvinced that Burga has told them everything, Madonna and Franz decide to do naked cop/gay cop. Madonna tries to clean Burga's wounds, but mistaken uses Franz' pee rag. Burga is unmoved by the gesture and stays quiet for the rest of the journey.</p>

  <p>Madonna's escape route adds two days of travelling to the group. She goes out, shoots a bambi then butchers it deftly in the middle of camp. During the night, the scent of fresh deer blood attracts a brown bear. While on watch, Liliana attempts to scare the bear away by banging pots and pans, which keeps the bear at the edge of camp. Unfortunately, one of the pots she grabbed was still hot from the cooking, and she won't be able to play until she gets a full night's rest in a bed. Sheila, now awake and alert rushes to scare the bear as well by jumping on Liliana, but the bard wasn't ready for the bounding Sheila and falls into the fire taking some minor burn damage. Franz yells at Sheila for disturbing her sleep, and MM rests undisturbed. Madonna ties a hunk of bambi to an arrow and shoots it over the bear's head. It bounds after it leaving the group alone. Sheila is positive her efforts scared off the bear and takes final watch.</p>

  <p>In the morning, MM heads off alone in an effort to heal his wounded manhood. He grinds a poultice from some local plants, something he's pretty sure he's seen people do before, and applies it liberally. He realizes all too late that the poultice has been made from poison ivy. He itches it constantly. Sylvia takes MM aside when he returns, and let's him know that she believes she can help him with his problem.</p>

  <h1>"That's just my ob piece"</h1>
  <hr>

  <p>The Funky Bunch arrive in Dark Tower, and immediately the group is glared at angrily by the townsfolk. Sheila had forgotten to mention that the last time she was here she'd attempted to overthrow the local government, but abadoned her allies telling them that she was "gathering reinforcements". The guards however seem to be thinking that the reinforcements are on their way with Sheila's return, and it's likely word is getting around. Sheila tells Liliana that they should break away from the group for a hot minute, to visit Chears, the copyright-safe tavern where everyone knows your brain. Tended by zombie Dead Tansen, whose reputation with the ladies even Marky Mark is a little jealous of, Chears stands quiet and the regulars are none too happy to see Sheila return.</p>

  <p>Marky Mark is upset that he wasn't invited to the bar, but he needs to tend to a raging "yeast infection". MM and Franz take the time to go with Dr. Faucet to find a town physician. Franz is dragging Berga around by a leash and ball gag. He is her dominator, and she is his sub. Even though Franz has no sensual repsonse to her, he lets her know that "There's only one shade of me, I am your grey".</p>

  <p>In addition, the group is becoming more suspicious of Sylvia's cover story of being a seamstress as she has neither the hands of a lifelong seamstress nor the competence. The Funky Bunch is about to look like Virgin Island refugees for real, so Madonna decides to look for clothing and inspect Dark Tower's well-stocked bazaar.</p>

  <p>In Chears, Sheila demands loudly that her once second in command Clit Cleft&#8212;AKA the man in the boat&#8212;a guy who's a little slow on the uptake but steadfastly loyal and works for the pony express. A Chears patron shouts that "Clit don't want to talk to you no more." Sheila responds with a measured decorum, "HOW DARE YOU? YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW! WE NEED TO HAVE A CHAT CLITTY BOY!" Liliana is clearly in the wrong bar and steps aside as Clit comes in, solemn, broken. He gestures to a corner table, and Dead Tanser groans a request for Liliana to begin playing for the tavern. Liliana does so, giving the pair the privacy they required. The patrons are very interested in music, as Chears is a very sad place. Two years ago Sheila bailed as her plans of kidnapping and theiving from Dark Tower's iron-first Baroness Mam Salone all failed miserably. Clit ended up spending a year in the city dungeon as a result. Salome was head admin of the Dark Tower's school, but as a result of the failed coup attempt, she turned more of her attention toward running the city. Nearly all of Sheila's loyalists were executed for their efforts. With a spark in her eye, Sheila looks to Clit and asks, "Clit, my darling, do you think you could fight for our cause?"</p>

  <p>Near the docks, where the ships bring in merchant stock, Madonna spies the crowd. "I think my breast approach is to find a sugar daddy." Within a few moments, she spies a well-dressed individual and approaches him. She walks up all sexy-like, and tells him that her entire family was attacked and that her clothes were taken. Unfortunately, Madonna's been travelling for days, and between the road grit covering her and a strong musk of a week without a shower, the nobleman is less than seduced. She lets him know that if he helps her out, she'd gladly return the favor. This seems to catch his attention, but he tells her that he can't have this conversation in public, and to meet him in a nearby alleyway in 15 minutes.</p>

  <p>In the secluded alley, the man introduces himself as Henry of House Thornwell. He asks what it is that Madonna can offer him. She tells him that she cleans up very well, and if you can front her money for clothes and a bath, she will make him a luxurious meal and provide entertainment. As luck would have it, House Thornwell is hosting a dinner party this evening and the head chef has left his employ. He hands her a small bag of coins, and a calling card. "Present this at the door shortly, and my staff will bring you to my kitchen. Come clean and well-dressed and if you can pull tonight off successfully, I will fund 'replacement clothing for your family'."

  <p>At a physician's office off the main road of Dark Tower, Dr. Faucet makes an introduction to Jane Benthey&#8212; a healer and apothecary that he has been writing letters to for months discussion various medical things. Faucet offers to stay for the healing session, and Franz goes first while holding Marky Mark's hand. Franz insists that cookies and suckers will fix it. He takes off a portion of his royal vestment to show the necrotic wound. "Where did you get this?" "In my shoulder," Franz replies. After a bit of back and forth MM shows Benthey his more-than-average assortment of daggers. She plucks the dagger that had made the wound, and requests time to study it. Franz lets Benthey know that MM is very sensitive about his penis, and is constantly asking, "Hey MM, how is your penis? Can I see your penis? He would normally show his penis, but maybe he's shy and you've only just met". Berga groans, and Franz snaps "SHHH BE QUIET WOMAN!. I'm gonna take my woman and get out. COME ON, BITCH! LADIES FIRST, BITCH". Jane gives Franz a cookie that he eats as he leaves the examination room.</p>

  <p>Marky Mark begins, "listen jane, there's something wrong with me." He undoes his belt and shows Benthey little Marky.</p>
  <p>"That's a perfectly average penis."</p>
  <p>"DADOY, that'st he problem. Days ago it was touching my calf. I stabbed an obelisk and instantly the stone exploded." The piece of obelisk hidding in MM's pants drops out, "That's just my ob piece."</p>
  <p>"Have you had that in contact with you the whole time? Why would you do that?"</p>
  <p>"The obelisk was intimidating me."</p> Benthey says that she'll need to send the obelisk to the Dark Tower, and gives him an ointment to handle the rash. She also gives him a candle to 'keep up appearances'. Marky Mark offers Benthey sexual services as recompense, and she says that she'll be interested in having that conversation once the rash clears.</p>

  <h1>8-mile</h1>
    <p> Sheila turns to Clit, "Darling, what did you have in mind? Many of our fellows here have compatriots." The Chears crowd grumbles. Clit looks Sheila directly in the eye, "I guess they have nothing better to do." Clit is wearing a hoodie, and clearly arouses the bar. Sheila and Liliana descend into the Chears meeting room followed by Clit and a handful of Clit's associates. Liliana stands at the makeshift lecturn silent as the group settles; Sheila next to her. She focuses on the air in the room, feels the tension and leans into it. The bard begins quietly, stomping out a low beat with her bootheel that begins synchronizing with the ill-tempered onlookers' heartbeats. She's captured them. The room seems to go dark except for a light beaming down onto Sheila.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">"Countrymen, patrons, my former dear friends..."</p>

    <p>Madonna, having just left the alleyway where Lord Thornwell has offered to hire her culinary and entertainment services, spies Mohanna heading toward her. The owl drops a note in her hand that says "Meet at Chears ASAP. Be ready to start the revolution with us, XOXO." Madonna though, is on a mission. The coin Thornwell gave her to purchase clothing appropriate for the grand luncheon gathering is put to good use. The ranger is now uncharacteristically clothed in an elegant gown matching the color of her skin. The gown reveals a tasteful tease of cleavage; a little slit up the side showing just a hint of thigh. In the Virgin Isles, dinner parties start at 2:30 in the afternoon, and it's nearly time.</p>

    <p>Madonna arrives at a kitchen in disarray but quickly takes command of the staff. Impossibly, she is able to coordinate several courses of forest ruffage and wild game so perfect the nobles hardly balk when a tip jar gets passed around. Lord Thornwell tosses in a handful of coins. Not wanting to upstaged, Lady Cromulent of the Seventh House of Dandy drops in a brooch that had been in her family for generations. Not wanting to be upstaged by her gesture, the Grand High Priest of the Cult of Eternal Generosity (whoever receives the most generosity in their lifetime wins) adds a pouch of black emeralds. This continues through the first and second course and by the time the jar returns to Madonna it's full of around 1000 coins and has earned her the full and complete admiration of the kitchen staff who simply love shafting the noble class.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.3em;">The crowd begins murmuring, unconciously swaying to the air pulsing all around them, "If you had one shot to get everything you ever wanted..."</p>

    <p>"YOU ARE A BAD DOCTOR, JANE." Prince Franz yells as he wraps his arms around her jar of lollipops, having just been told he would have to wait to hear back from the Dark Tower before Jane understood more about Franz and Marky Mark's  afflictions. "Marky Mark, would you like a lollipop? YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE!" Marky Mark adjusts his candle, takes out a dagger, and pokes Franz in the forehead. Blood drips down Franz' nose, and MM draws it onto his finger and licks it off.</p>

    <p>"Don't ever take my lollipop again." Franz licks all of the lollipops, Markly Mark does the same. Franz and MM stare angrily at each other, neither backing down. <span style="font-style: italic; color: #777">You know that part in awful romantic comedies when social opposites have a fight and they're about to explode with fury and just start making out instead? That's what's going on right now.</span></p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">"Would you capture it, or let it slip?"</p>

    <p>Franz recognizes the tension in the air, and takes command of the dynamic, "Marky Mark, I would like a hug." MM calms, and acquiesces. Franz is not intimidated by Marky Mark. MM is thoroughly aroused. They leave the physician's office and walk the streets of Dark Tower.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.7em;">"Cuz your palms may be sweaty, your arms may be heavy..."</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, dessert is being served at Madonna's afternoon dinner theater party, and it is time for her to fulfill the second part of Lord Thornwell's request: entertainment. Madonna tucks away her overflowing tip jar, and focuses. Hiding in plain sight, in the middle of a banquet hall can't be that much different than fading into the background of the forest can it?</p>

    <p>At the westerly side of the banquet hall, massive windows reveal a beatiful autumn sunset over Dark Tower's harbor. The room is bathed in amber light as Madonna walks from the kitchen into the center of the tables. The dining nobles' conversation drop from polite tittering to complete, contented silence. "Tonight, I shall perform an act of illusion. Standing amongst you all, at your command, I shall disappear. But, you must recite an incantation, and focus entirely on me in order for it to work. You must say the name 'Joseph Smith'. When I disappear, the only way to have me return is to relieve yourselves of additional coin."</p>

    <p>The diners begin muttering to themselves as Madonna stands motionless. "Jussasmif," muttered quietly by a few crowd members bold enough to break the silence. Madonna flickers briefly, but is still plainly visible. "Josif Smiss," now spoken at a normal voice by half the room. Madonna fades between half and full opacity, the crowd gasping and standing to see her partially leave and return to view.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 2.0em;">"Perhaps vomit on your sweater already"</p>

    <p>"JOSEFSMYTH," cries the entire room. In an instant, Madonna is gone. The room collective stands in amazement, circling the empty center of the room. Then, almost at once, a gurgling is felt deep in the bowels of the guests. There are several hastily offered pardons as some diners toward the center of the room attempt to excuse themselves, but the cramping becomes worse. All too late, the guests understood what had happened; the meal all to perfectly prepared had hidden a sinister motive.</p>

    <p>The waitstaff, unaware of the nobles' discomfort stand at the covered dessert dishes. They lift the closhes, and the smell permeates what little resolve the crowd had remaining.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 6em; text-align: center"><img src="/img/tenor.gif"><img src="/img/tenor.gif"><img src="/img/tenor.gif"><img src="/img/tenor.gif"><br>MOM'S SPAGHETTI<br>

  <p>As the room full of Dark Tower's elite becomes flooded in vomit, Madonna gets the fuck out carrying a small fortune. For some reason unknown to him, Marky Mark begins dry heaving.</p>

  <p>Madonna runs past Franz and MM, telling them that Sheila and Liliana have requested their presence at Chears. She gives them both a set of peasant clothes. Franz promises he'll wear them underneath his nicer clothes. The pants are too big for Marky Mark (womp womp) but thankfully the candle is a triple-wicker. They head out.</p>

  <p>The crowd at Chears is sparked, cheering and yelling howls of rebellion and hope. Liliana is somehow manipulating the light and air of the room through her percussive performance. Even Dead Tansen is getting carried away by it. Sheila addresses the crowd of brigands directly, her voice loud and clear over the yells and hollers of the crowd, "I have brought the reinforcements we need!"</p>

  <p>Madonna, Franz and Marky Mark walk down into the tavern's underbelly commanding the space holding enough stolen coin to fund a revolution.</p>

    <p>Word quickly escapes Lord Thornwell's manor via ecstatic and underappreciated waitstaff. Dark Tower has played host to a beautiful trickster who, through what could only have been Fae magic, created a seven course meal from scraps, emptied the purses of a great number of nobles, then made them so horribly ill that they uncontrollably soiled themselves&#8212;and each other&#8212;for nearly half an hour.</p>
    <p>After finally recovering from the exhaustion of it all, Thornwell had to use the vast majority of his reserved and most precious textiles to refashion clothing replacements for the nobles soiled in his home. Disgraced and ruined, Thornwell manor was sold at auction and burned.</p>
    <p>Commonfolk love the Fae Queen, and often leave bits of coin and food scrap in the middle of their dinner tables as an offering of reverence. It is also said that if you say her name in the mirror three times, a mostly naked woman will appear and make you puke your brains out.</p>

<h1>"It's bennedick"</h1>

<p>The crowd in Chears is rowdy, and engergized. Franz is bored almost immediately. Seeing the rest of the Funky Bunch come in, Sheila attempts to call them up on stage. MM ignores her, and orders an ale. Madonna attempts to sneak away to hide her loot in her dress. Liliana tries to help, and ends up causing all of Madonna's jewels and coinage to come tumbling out.</p>

<p>Franz introduces himself to the crowd, Sheila backs up his reputation by telling the crowd that Franz has killed many men. At first the crowd is disbelieving that someone so bedecked with jewels could fight, but soon, they realize the glory of the one standing before them. The crowd begins shouting questions, "Where can we get clothes like that?" "How can we dye our eyes that color?" Franz reigns over them while Madonna and Sheila go into a side room.</p>

<p>Liliana approaches MM and asks him to come into a side room for a "girls' thing". He relents, taking a pair of ales with him. She asks Madonna how she got all the loot, and Madonna dodges letting her in on the details</p>

<p>Sheila begins, "I believe we are at crossroads..." then tells the party about the insurgence that she'd started before leaving Dark Tower. "We can either bail on the city, or we can have a little fun, lead a little riot, and maybe get a town under our control." She goes on to explain about Mam Salone, and how she runs the academy and the city. Liliana asks if the guards can be bought, and Sheila tells her about Benedick Cumbersnatch and MM is confused by the name. To clarify, Liliana offers "You know, like *your* dick; it's Benedick." MM nurses his drink.

<p>Cumbersnatch was a guard that Sheila had gained leverage on, using him as a source of information during the first insurgency. The leverage Sheila describes is proof that Cumbersnatch's education and training was falsified when he gained a position in the town's guard. Clit tells them that Benedick is now Mam's head of security. He also tells the group that Benedick is getting married in the next couple of days to Karen from Finance, and ex-romance of Sheila's. Sheila suggests a maroon wedding, and believes that his fiance is still living with her family. The plan is to go visit Karen's home tonight.</p>

<p>MM suggests infiltrating the wedding as caterers, and Sheila agrees. Liliana asks if anyone knows how to cook, and again Madonna dodges the question. Madonna's not into the idea, and wants to go the route of getting Benedick in hot water at his bachelor party. Karen from Finance may know where it's being held, and it's time to get him in some trouble.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Franz is living up the attention of the crowd. He's letting them know about his boots designed by Louie of Vitton, and then lets the crowd know that he is in need of a squire. Sheila tells the crowd about the plan, tellin them to reconvene tomorrow night, and the crowd disperses. "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We fought for these ideals (then something in my notes about the first cabinet battlefrom Hamilton). Reach out to your fellow loyalists."</p>

<p>As the crowd is leaving, a small, old, bent-backed man comes up to Franz. He tells Franz that his layabout son could use a job like squire to a fine noble powerhouse like Franz. Franz is then introduced to an absolute mountain of an individual who, "this is my son Angus McCaskill." Franz gives Angus the bust-necklace of Lord Marsten, and then uses him as a throne, and does a damn fine impersonation of a ventriloquist's dummy.</p>

<p>As they head toward Karen's, Sheila lets the group know about her complicated past with Karen. Liliana asks how Sheila feels about her getting married. Franz sings, "Sheila has a girlfried K-I-S-S-N-G". The group quickly and quietly arrives at the From Finance home because Debbie in Scheduling fucked up the guard rotation. Liliana takes the time to learn more about Angus, asking if his name is his real name or a nickname. Angus lets her know that the name was his grandfather's, which demands Franz ask if Angus killed his own grandfather.</p>

<p>When they arrive, Franz yells "MR AND MRS FROM FINANCE" at the door, while Sheila knocks. As it turns out, Sheila ghosted Karen from Finance when she abandoned the insurgency. Mr. from Finance answers the door, and greets Sheila in the absent, constantly unaware warmth he's known for. He invites all of them in. Sheila spies the wedding invitation tacked to the wall, and motions for Liliana to swipe it. Liliana asks if she can get herself a glass of water, and the confused Mr from Finance lets her help herself. Liliana gets the water, and stashes the invitation in her mandolin.</p>

<p>Mr. from Finance asks why Sheila left. In tears, Sheila tells him that she was in danger, and by staying she was putting Karen from Finance in danger. Sheila heard the news of Karen's marriage and had to come back to talk to her. Liliana attempts to pull Franz outside, but Franz isn't having it. MM is sitting in a chair, spinning around, attempting to dizzy himself. For some reason, Madonna believes that this would be the most opportune time to shove her boobs into his face. MM catches a whiff of old-noble puke and starts retching all over Madonna. Madonna revenge pukes all over Marky Mark. Mr. from Finance, very understandably, stands up and demands to know what the hell is going on, and why you're all making such a mess. Sheila says that if he tells them where the bachelor party is tonight they'll all leave.</p>

<p>MM stands up, dizzy. "Guys, remember that tower statue thing? IT DID THIS TO ME." He then drops his pants, all the way down to his ankles showing the entire room his average wang. A sandlewood scented candle thumps to the ground, rolling and hitting a gobsmacked Mr. from Finance in the foot. from Finance erupts, "MRS FROM FINANCE IS GOING TO KILL ME." Sheila presses about the bachelor party. "IT'S AT THE REBEL TANKARD! NOW GET OUT!"</p>

<p>Franz picks up the candle and hands it to Mr. from Finance, "A wedding present, please have a lovely evening." And they all leave. Madonna and Mark Mark strip completely and run toward the harbor in order to wash off. Liliana goes to check on them, and Franz follows so that he doesn't feel left out.</p>

<p>Liliana takes a moment to examine the invitation. From its quality, she surmises that the town's elite are likely to be at the wedding. The plan: Sheila will use goldenroot to chum up Benedick Cumbersnatch. Plan B: Madonna will either perform a salacious act, or just pretend to. She'll figure it out as they go along. MM still wants to infiltrate as caterers, and Franz wants to know how Madonna will fit into the cake. Madonna offers instead to just wear two cupcakes. (Meta: "If you go in the back door, you don't need Plan B")</p>

<p>Sheila, Franz, and Liliana head to the front while MM and Madonna head toward the rear door to the kitchen. The front door crew spies a competent bouncer checking invitations, and asks for theirs. Franz looks at Angus (Aggie), and the squire steps right up the bouncer, staring down into his eyes, and just starts yelling. "DO YOU KNOW WHO THE FUCK THIS IS? DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF SHIT YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN IF YOU DON'T LET HIM IN NOW? DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHO YOU'RE INSULTING?" The bouncer wets himself a little, and lets the group through. Liliana slaps the clipboard out of his hands and the bouncer sheepishly chases after it. Franz pats Angus on the head and tells him he can have a club soda.</p>

<p>The bachelor party has a bunch of city guards, all huddled together telling war stories. Benedick Cumbersnatch is sitting in the center of a semi-circle of them drinking away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Madonna uncharacteristically waltzes into the kitchen like she owns the place, and the kitchen staff barely registers that she and MM have entered. MM is playing her bodyguard, and Madonna is the entertainment. They both grab waitstaff aprons. MM goes over to the eggs, makes up a dope meringue and makes Madonna a bikini from it with sweet buns.

<p>In the back, madonna just waltzes in. MM is the bodyguard, Madonna is the entertainment. They grab waitstaff aprons. MM goes over to the eggs, and works up a dope meringue. MM gives M a meringue bikini, with sweet buns. Liliana sneaks back into the kitchen to check on them, and sees MM patterning Madonna with gumdrops.</p>

<p>Funk music kicks up in the main hall. The night's just getting started.</p>

<h1>"Brendan can't do drunk voice anymore"</h1>

<p>Marky Mark and Madonna are in the kitchen getting ready for her perfomance. MM is strategically applying meringue, sweet buns, and gumdrops to Madonna. And a ganache. Liliana comes in and attempts to make off with one of Madonna's sweetbuns, but MM slaps her hand away. Madonna convinces Liliana to accompany her musically when she attempts to incriminate Dickie. With all of this commotion, MM picks up on the kitchen staff beginning to be suspicious. One of the chefs, a woman in her 40s who's never seen a day off,  leaves her station to notify the bar's security. MM puts down his whisk, removes his apron, looks across the kitchen staff and bows, "It's been an honor". He follows after her.</p>

<p>Franz notices MM following a woman leaving the kitchen, her eyes focused on one of the bouncers. Franz nudges Sheila into action, and she fake drunks her way over to stall the chef. Sheila spills a drink on the chef, stalling her just long enough for MM to apply his incredibly sophisticated seduction style. "We fuckin' or fightin'?" These are the words the chef has waited to hear her entire life. After years of celebacy, her resolve is broken and she pulls MM into the dry goods closet.</p>

<p>Franz keeps Bennedick (Dickie) occupied by being a barbarian prince determined to invade the conversation. "DICKIE PARTY! YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED!". Franz buddies up to the groomsparty while Aggie sits at the bar slamming a club soda. Madonna's melting, it's now or never. Liliana's music takes over the room as Madonna gives Dickie a personal dance that makes him forget all about getting married. Everyone is uncomfortable, especially his groomsmen. Sheila steps in and slides a goldenroot laced dagger against his wrist, just enough to have the poison seep in.</p>

<p>Dickie turns his attention away from Madonna, and is pleased to see Sheila after all this time. He gives her a big hug, and Sheila congratulates him on the engagement. Dickie's the only person having a good time, and Franz will have none of it. He stands up and orders the band to continue funking the place up. Dickie's groomsmen are sick of dealing with Dickie's bullshit, and the help Franz party up the place. The barkeep sends a waiter over to Franz to see if there's anything the tavern can provide to help out, since the bachelor's clearly killing the mood.</p>

<p>Franz requests that the sexiest man and woman the bar has employed get nekkid (mostly) and start pouring shots down people's throats. He also says that Aggie should get the VIP bathroom key and all the drinks he wants. The bartender is happy to comply; shots are poured, the crowd is raging, and somehow we learned that a motorboating is better than rowboating (a slow and vigorous motorboat).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sheila is chatting with Dickie. She takes the drink he offers her and tosses it over her shoulder; Dickie's way too intoxicated to notice or care that much. "So, Dickie, I've been travelling a while. What's been happening here?"</p>

<p>Dickie takes another drink and tells Sheila, "Things have been good here since you bailed. We knew who everyone in the operation was, so gathering them up wasn't hard. I captured most of them and turned them all in. Mam executed some of them, some of them are still in prison."</p>

<p>Suspicious, Sheila asks, "I can't believe they let Clit through, what happened?" Dickie clams up, looking almost sober and definitely scrambling to remember if he's already said too much. "It is a little loud in here isn't it?" Sheila remarks, "How about we step outside to finish our conversation." Dickie nods and the pair heads out.</p>

<p>MM and the purposefully unnamed chef finish their interlude, which has resulted in ruining the majority of the dry goods in the closet BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL WET. She leaves MM to get back to work, but not before calling him her "little pinto bean." MM takes a nap on one of the dryer shelves.</p>

<p>Franz sends the half-naked bar folks, Jack and Jill, over to Dickie's best man, Ellis. It's clear Ellis is more interested in Jack, and Franz picks up on it. Ellis sees he's being watched, and heads over to sit next to the Prince. Ellis is disgusted by Dickie's behavior, but would rather get to know Franz a little better, starting in with the inane small talk people are supposed to have in bars like this.</p>

<p>Outside in an alleyway, Sheila asks Dickie again about Clit. Dickie looks her square in the face, "Clit's been one of ours the whole time."</p>

<h1>"women uuuuggghh"</h1>

<p>Sheila, realizing that her ally Clit will be of no assistance is left with the solitary option of going through Dickie. He's seen Sheila's bad guy routine before and has finally sobered up. He pulls out a guard whistle but before he can blow it, Sheila threatens to ruin everything going on with Karen from Finance. Dickie tells Sheila that the best time to strike would be during his wedding since most of the guard will be there. Sheila yells "SUCK MY CLIT" as Dickie leaves the alleyway.</p>

<p>Madonna is very sticky, and wants to go take a bath. She heads to Chears. Clit sees her walk in, "fun night?". "Always!" Madonna responds as she asks Dead Tansen if the tavern offers bath services. Dead Tansen is efficient, but not very gentle. She opts to go it alone, she just wants the Marky Mark off of her.</p>

<p>Franz and Ellis are dancing and grinding on the dance floor. Aggie's at the bar drinking, looking uncomfortable. Liliana gets him off the hook and tells Franz that Aggie should probably head back to Chears. Franz, not wanting to be distracted from his date tells him to go. Aggie heads back to the tavern. "Franz, how long are you going to be here" asks a hard-breathing Ellis.</p>

<p>"I might just stay forever. Everyone loves me and nobody from my group paid any attention to me when I went to the bar. They went into a room." Franz continues telling Ellis about what they've done in town while Liliana stands nearby in case Franz tells him too much. Ellis mentions that he has a plus-one for the wedding, and coyly asks if Franz will go with him. Franz loses it and loves the idea. "I HAVE SO MANY SPARKLIES!"</p>

<p>Liliana: "so what time should Franz be there?" Franz is like WTF? Franz offers to go with Ellis to his place, Ellis thinks that's a great idea. Elbow-in-elbow, they leave for Ellis' house.</p>

<p>Liliana goes looking for Marky Mark and follows the sound of snoring. She finds him sleeping on a wet sack of rice. Sheila pops in and shakes his arm to wake him up. MM doesn't stir. There's an odd and permeating smell in the room. Musky. MM tried to cuddle Liliana. Liliana bends his fingers back, "Why is everything wet in here?" MM wakes up, and agrees to leave but first he needs a sandwich. He grabs some proschiutto, fresh cheese, and makes a toasty footlong. Sheila fills them in on what's going on.</p>

<p>The good news is that the group knows where the wedding's going to be. The bad news is that Clit has likely already informed Dark Tower about Sheila's insurrection plans. To further complicate things, Franz is going to the wedding as the date of the best man. Clit has cost hundreds of lives with his betrayal; we need to make sure Clit doesn't leave Chears alive. Sheila lets them know that she knows Clit better than they do and has never had a problem finding Clit before. "We need to find out everything he knows."</p>

<p>The plan is that Liliana will make her way into the Chears side room while Sheila laces his drink with Goldenroot. MM's job is to incapacitate, and not kill, Clit so that the group can get information.</p>

<p>Clit notices Liliana head to the back room, but doesn't seem disturbed. Sheila orders two ales, sends Aggie to bed, and asks Clit to step into the side room to talk. Marky Mark asks Dead Tansen if it's ok to eat his sandwich in the bar, and emphasizes the request by tossing it all over the floor in front of him. MM quickly reassembles the sandwich. Dead Tansen uses a broom handle to point to a sign that says "No outside food." MM starts making sexy eyes at him, and Dead Tansen pokes the sign, dislodging a smaller sign that continues "unless you eat it slowly in front of me" MM does so, spending more time with the sandwich than the unnamed chef.</p>

<p>Sheila, Liliana, and Clit are in the back room. Sheila starts in, "Clit, remember John, sent him into some manor, remember him? Son was named Liam (it still is). Beautiful wife Patriarchy (Patty for short)." Liliana sets the mood with some Sarah McLoughlin ASPCA stuff. Clit might break during this interrogation, but Sheila knows how competent Clit is and that there's a really good chance the Goldenroot isn't doing anything to him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Madonna is relaxing in the tub. Perfectly serene and tranquil when she gets a tingling sensation that something's going on downstairs. Her matron, goddess Slushie Bicardi B tells her that secrets are abound. Madonna descends and joins the group in the side room, casting Sanctuary so that if any poison applied is successful, she would know about it. Currently, there is no effective poison in the room.</p>

<p>"What was your worst moment, Clit? Your greatest loss?" Sheila asks, waiting to turn the knife. </p>

<p>"It was when you left, Sheila. it broke me." Sheila throws a punch at Clit, but he sees it coming and stands up out of the way. Liliana slips out to get MM. "Were you always a traitor to the cause?!" Sheila yells at him. Clit raises an eyebrow, drinks his ale, "Betraying the cause? Funny, coming from you. For all your talk about the greater good, when you started to see things going south, you left. Instead of protecting those kids, you ran and left them to die."</p>

<p>In a happier place, Ellis and Franz walk up to the door of his one bedroom apartment. Inside, Ellis' spartan decor lies in stark contrast to pretty much everything Franz stands for. He doesn't even have servants. Franz wants to plan what they're going to wear, and Ellis tells him that he has to wear vestments chosen by the bride. He changes into them and they're hideous, Franz says, "I don't want to take anything away from the bride, because it's her day, and women uuuuggghh. For the ceremony, wear the thing. I will be dressed in something far more fabulous." Ellis asks if Franz could help him pick out somethign to wear at the reception. Franz tells Ellis that in Barb Area men wear traditional kilts made out of bunny fur, with gold trimmings at the bottom. No top, specifically no top. But like a chain sash. Franz, of course, has a set that will fit Ellis. He asks if they should go retreive it in the morning after breakfast.</p>

<h1>"I certainly hope your mother is lovlier than this ring."</h1>

<p>The sideroom of Chears is filled with Liliana's anthem to Marky Mark, and the musk and presence of the song's subject. Clit knows where the threat in this room is and has his eyes fixed on the warrior. Sheila beings, "I'm going to ask you some questions. When did you turn on us? They said you were always against us." Clit stares at Sheila, and tries to get her source out of her. He fails, but he assumes the information is coming from Dickie anyway.</p>

<p>"Dickie would tell you anything he thought up in order to keep his job. It's cushy, and he doesn't have to do much to get the status he longs for. Listen, Sheila, I'll go along with you if you can prove your intentions. We need someone out of the way." The target Clit proposes is the Dark Tower Minister of Education Elores Dumbridge. It's because of her that the Tower became such a shitty place to learn. MM is fixated on wanting to beat Clit, but that will have to come later.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Franz and Ellis are waking from their night spooned together. Franz is the big spoon, obviously. Ellis kisses Franz on the forehead and goes to make breakfast. Franz takes the opportunity to prune Ellis' already spartan wardrobe. While tossing out some old shirts, Franz finds a ring of some value, it has a fairly evident family crest. Ellis comes in to see Franz snooping. "I wanted to make sure it wasn't for me. I certainly hope your mother is lovlier than this ring." Ellis explains that the ring is one of the only things he has left from his family. He changes the subject to let Franz know that this evening he will need to attend Dickie and Karen from Finance's wedding rehearsal. Franz notes that this tradition is strange, "in Barb Area you just say "I'm getting married", then you just do it. Then you go have lunch or something. Sometimes people have a huntymoon and go hunt somethin to kill and eat." </p>

<p>Ellis lets Franz know that the rehearsal will be at the Olive Garden, where they grow olives and have all the soup, salad, and breadsticks you can eat. Everything is covered in olive oil. When you enter, they bathe you in olive oil and herbs, and people come up to you and sop bread on your body. Vegans have lettuce leaves that they just rub on you.</p>

<p>MM has been circling Clit all night, getting little rest. For some reason he begins singing the alphabet, and focuses mainly on the 'g' (from Becky, lulz).</p>

<p>Sheila has a plan. The group is really good at impersonating wait staff (and fucking them). However, as a backup plan Sheila belives she'll be able to make a shrinking poison from the sample she collected in the Bognan sewers. The group should find themselves some service outfits and get in with the waitstaff. Liliana and Madonna decide to go get outfits.</p>

<p>Before anyone has a chance to leave, Franz and Ellis walk in hand-in-hand. "He is my boyfriend," Franz announces. Sheila wants to leave, but Franz stands in her way. Ellis knows exactly who Sheila is and Liliana picks up on it. Franz continues, "Since we got to Dark Tower you have all been very rude to me. Ellis needs more clothes. I threw out half his wardrobe." Ellis glares. Liliana and Madonna decide to take Ellis shopping. Ellis looks skeptically at Madonna and asks, "So you know alot about clothes?"</p>

<p>"Why cover up perfection? But for you? Let's figure something out for you," Madonna quips. Franz comes down from his room upstairs and hands over his Barb Arean kilt for Ellis to wear at the reception.</p>

<p>Madonna knows the garment district in Dark Tower and leads Liliana, Franz, and Ellis there. At the outlet shop, they have a little bit of everything and even serve sausage MacMuffins till 11. Madonna is gettin some food, while Franz and Ellis check out the Fabulous Men's section. Liliana lets people know that for traditional Dark Tower weddings the bride wears all red, staff wears all black. After bit of meandering, Liliana and Madonna become aware of the fact that people there are beginning to whisper to one another while gesturing in their direction.</p>
