        <h1>The Story So Far</h1>
        <p>The Funky Bunch arrived in Bagnan in search of Prince Franz' precious family necklace. They paid for rooms at the Randy Giraffe and began their search.</p>
        <p>Shiela, who had stolen Prince Franz' necklace made haste to a the Rusty Copper—a pawn shop owned by Keeva—and convinced her to hold onto the necklace with the promise that she would be given a portion of its eventual sale. She agreed.</p>
        <p>During this, the rest of the party met Loranna, a scribe, and attempted to hire her to make some Lost Necklace posters for Prince Franz. Her door was locked, but that was no match for the Funky Bunch who broke in anyway. They saw that Loranna was performing forgery services for none other than Steve the Crime Boss.</p>
        <p>They were given a price (that no one could afford since everyone's broke as fuck), and separated to look around the city for more information.</p>
        <p>Liliana spoke with Barto, the owner of the Randy Giraffe, and he offered her enough money to pay for the Lost Necklace posters if she would get herself hired at the rival tavern, The Snuggly Ostritch, and sing a song promoting the Randy Giraffe. She agreed, returned with a writ of performance from Captain Sven, and prepared to go on stage that night.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the party found their way to the Rusty Copper in search of the necklace. Feeling the heat, Shiela changed the deal with Keeva, telling her to immediately pawn the necklace to Prince Franz. Having been told of its value, and knowing she now had a prince over a barrel, she offered the necklace to the party for 10,000 gold pieces.</p>
        <p>The party negotiated, and Keeva gave them an opportunity to retreive a ledger containing evidence of Steve the Crime Lord's misdeeds in the possession of Lord Marsten. The party agreed that they would take this course of action.</p>
        <p>Liliana, Shiela and Marky Mark came up with an executed a plan to get Captain Sven out of the picture during Liliana's song, knowing that the bar owner would never let the party out alive after the kind of song she had planned. Marky Mark would charm his way into the Snuggly Ostritch's chef's pants giving Shiela an opportunity to dose Captain Sven's dinner with sleeping poison</p>
        <p>Madonna and Prince Franz said "fuck it" and broke into the Rusty Copper that night and stole the necklace back while Liliana performed .</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The plan worked, and with Sven knocked out Liliana performed her advertisement for the Randy Giraffe. The crowd turned on her quickly, throwing beer steins, chairs, glitter bombs, and anything else they could. With the protective forcefield around the stage failing, she cashed in her favor with Shiela giving the rogue a passionate kiss winning the crowd back. Liliana caught sight of Loranna rushing clumsily out of the tavern.</p>
        <p>Prince Franz, Madonna and Marky Mark were hanging out near the entrance of the Snuggly Ostritch when Loranna came out and asked Marky Mark to escort her through the streets of Bagnan to her home in the residential district. He agreed and the two left; followed "deftly" behind by everyone else in the party, convinced that Marky Mark was up to some skeez.</p>
        <p>After winding Marky Mark through the city in the hopes that he wouldn't remember how to get to his house, she offered him a drink back at her place only to have Liliana rush up and start fangirling Loranna giving Shiela the opportunity to knock out and kidnap Loranna to use her as leverage against Steve the Crime Boss</p>
        <p>Understandably pissed off at the group, Marky Mark hefted Loranna over his shoulder and ran her back through the city away from the group, but right into an ambush of Steve the Crime Boss' men. Marky Mark dispatched one of them, but was so distracted by the ambush, that Madonna snuck in and picked up Loranna's unconscious body whisking her away from the fight. The rest of the party caught up to Marky Mark, and Prince Franz landed a savage blow on the remaining rogue, but not before he blew a signal whistle alerting the entire area that something was wrong.</p>
        <p>As Madonna rushed through the city streets as guided by her owl, Loranna whispered to her "Please help me, you have to get me away from Steve the Crime Lord". Madonna lead Loranna out of the city to a waterfall grotto, then sent her owl back with a note for the party letting them know where she was going to be.</p>
        <p>The party left at in the alley with the dead thugs scattered, except for Marky Mark who was determined to get something out of the night's adventure. As he looted the corpses, five thieves came out of the shadows and surrounded him. Marky Mark summoned some good vibrations and dispatched all five enemies by hurling blades into their foreheads. After a quick loot, Marky Mark ran, catching up with the rest of the party who'd regrouped at the Randy Giraffe where they received Madonna's note.</p>
        <p>Barto told the group that he'd cover for them as they escaped, knowing that the Festering Scar would be on them if they waited around. The party Bagnon, and met up with Madonna and Loranna where Loranna told them that Steve the Crime Boss was forcing her and her sister Keeva to perform underhanded services for the crime syndicate using their parents lives as leverage. The party now has a decision to make whether or not they want to help the scribe and her family, or get the hell out of the area.</p>
        <p>Oh, and Marky Mark's penis has been massively erect for at least four hours</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The group conversed with Loranna, and she convinced them to save her family while she waited at the grotto. Marky Mark earned a new verse by quieting his erection on a nearby, mossy tree.</p>
        <p>In order to reenter the town, Madonna suggested that the group contact her friend Dexter: a seamstress who lives on the outskirts of Bagnan. Dexter was delighted that Madonna was finally willing to let him dress her, even if it was in peasant clothes. The group planned to enter the town as textile sellers wearing the peasant sarapes Dexter prepared.</p>
        <p>As they entered the town, they saw a band of well-oiled strapping young men lead by Captain Sven of the Snuggly Ostritch rushing directly to the Randy Giraffe. The band of Glitter Boys split up and began nailing all of the tavern's entrances shut. The Funky Bunch ran to the rear and dispatched the gang, but not before Captain Sven ordered flaming bombs be thrown into the Randy Giraffe.</p>
        <p>Marky Mark rushed dick first into the back door and Shiela made her way in to save the trapped patrons. She's able to convince Barto to leave his office, but while he was distracted she grabbed proof that Barto didn't even own the bar in the first place!.</p>
        <p>Barto escapes the bar, and presents the group with a bottle of La Virgen Roja, an amazingly well-crafted and respected run from the Virgen Islands and heads off, while Sven and the Glitter Boys return to the Ostritch. The party did not walk away completely unscathed though: Prince Franz has suffered what is apparently a mortal wound.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>The Funky Bunch surveyed the city, and saw that the commons were being ransacked by the Festering Scar. Shiela noticed that their efforts, while seemingly random and chaotic, were actually clever ruses to allow for the Scar to focus getting their people into their buildings and smuggling criminal stuff out</p>
  <p>The party didn't hesitate, and wanting to both rescue Loranna's family and collect some dirt on Steve the Crime boss, they split up: Sheila and Franz headed toward Lord Marsten's manor, while Lilianna, Madonna and Marky Mark made their way toward Loranna's home.</p>
  <p>Shiela was able to help she and Franz get past the city guard blockades, and when that failed, Franz was able to use his nobility and charm to convince the guards that they were guests of Lord Marsten and they had an appointment to see him. The guards granted them access to the noble quarter without further delay.</p>
  <p>Marky Mark, Lilianna and Madonna fought their way toward Loranna's home. Madonna shot two of them deftly, while Liliana sang the ballad of Marky Mark to bolster his strength. Marky Mark snapped the neck of one of the rogues, but not before he was able to bury a blade into Lilianna's shoulder. Enraged, Marky Mark lept at the thief, crotch-to-face, and snapped his neck between two powerful thighs. Madonna dispatched the third brgand and they were left to enter Loranna's home, finding the music box they'll be using to convince Keeva and her parents that the Funky Bunch is to be trusted.</p>
  <p>Franz and Shiela had less luck. After failing to convince Lord Marsten's butler that they have business with Lord Marsten, the pair break into the manor via first floor window, situated directly above the Marsten matriarch's urn and ashes. Having shattered both the urn and table the urn was resting on by stumbling through the window, they were confronted by a maid and butler very displeased to see them.</p>
  <p>The pair discovered Lord Marsten only hires former martial artists, and their attempts to attack the waitstaff left them disarmed and disadvantaged. Prince Franz was having nothing of this, and stood against Shiela in support of the peasants. Thinking quickly, Shiela recalled that Lord Marsten treats his staff like garbage, and was able to convince the staff to let them gain access to the house after convincing the maid and butler that she and Franz were starting a people's revolution; uncovering corrupution and bringing the rich to justice using Barto's forged deed as leverage.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Meanwhile, under the supportive song of Liliana, accompanied by the sensual dance of a naked Madonna, Marky Mark busts down Loranna's door and the group enters. Liliana takes the time to dig through Loranna's papers and finds dirt on Lord Marsten revealing him to have a brute squad who seduce the gay community and then assault them (The Family Value Militia, AKA the Gayschtoppo). In addition, Loranna kept documents revealing that massive homophobe Lord Marsten has a secret life as the super fabulous Mike Hot-Pence. The group finds a secret door leading to an underground tunnel and descend just as members of the Festering Scar crash into Loranna's house.</p>
  <p>In Marston's Manor, Prince Franz and Shiela search through Marsten's study looking for and finding Steve the Crime Boss' ledger. The ledger holds details of Steve the Crime Boss shorting and grifting his fellow criminals. In addition, as a token of his esteem, Shiela finds a chromed bust of Lord Marsten and fashions it into a gaudy amulet perfect for Prince Franz. Franz on the other hand, is not satisfied with the ledger, or the amulet and insists on continuing his search for Lord Marston's brooch collection.</p>
  <p>The pair enter his quarters, and while Franz is searching Marsten's closet, a young maid enters the bedroom and sees them lurking around. Shiela's attempts to win the maid over fails as the maid's family has been in service to the Marsten family for years, and the maid initiates a complete lockdown of the house. Not interested in any further diplomacy, Prince Franz uses the gifted amulet to bludgeon the fuck out of the maid before heading out. The pair leave with ledger and brooch in hand, covered in maid brains.</p>
  <p>Prince Franz and Shiela escape the manor and the area, and head toward Keeva's home. The tunnels beneath Loranna's home also leads Liliana, Madonna, and Marky Mark to Keeva's home as well. Having found each other, the party begins the search for Keeva and her family</p>
  <hr>
  <p>At Keeva's Prince Franz and Madonna take advantage of Keeva's bathing basin while Marky Mark defends the Festering Scar members rushing through the tunnels in pursuit. Marky Mark hurled a molotov cocktail cutting two rogues off, but left an opening for the third rogue to stab him in the ass. MM pulled the rogue up into Keeva's as Franz pushed a couch over the trap door. Though the assassin was enraged, Madonna offered her bosoms to comfort him, and he collapsed into them, weeping. She offered him lavendar tea laced with a poison from Shiela to make him pliable and he tells them everything.</p>
  <p>He says that Keeva is in the sewers, and that they tend to be angry; calling it "The Perfect Shitstorm". While the rogue is being spooned by Marky Mark, Shiela finds out that the only way Keeva would be released is if Loranna is brought back, and discovered some information about those guarding the sewer entrance.</p>
  <p>The group decides that they will act as if Shiela is their prisoner, and they're turning her over to get into Steve the Crime Boss' good graces. They left the assassin to sleep, but not before collecting his Festering Scar insignia (a wrought-iron cloak clasp in the shape of a scarred mask).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <h2>Party Reaches Level 2!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Shiela learns how to apply poison more effectively and gains Charisma. Additionally, she and Prince Franz have resolved the stolen item bond while forming a new bond with Liliana</li>
    <li>Franz' reputation for destruction can now impact subordinates of crushed foes. The prince bolstered his Charisma</li>
    <li>Liliana has learned to be more effectively while healing and focused on her Wisdom</li>
    <li>Marky Mark continues to master dick-fu, becoming more deadly to attackers. He has grown stronger, and has gained some sympathy from Madonna</li>
    <li>Madonna has learned to hide herself in natural surroundings, and has become more intelligent</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The Funky Bunch was advised to seek out Sander, a Festering Scar guard protecting the entrance to the sewers. He was to be the point of contact for the group to turn over Shiela in an attempt to get into Scar territory. The only contact being made though was Marky Mark's sword cutting him from right shoulder to left temple when attempts to palaver failed.</p>
<p>Madonna wildly thrust her bosoms at the remaining Scar guard attempting an ancient ranger grappling technique, but ended up getting clipped and bloodied. Encouraged by the heartening song of Liliana, Prince Franz stepped toward the brigand and cut him in half, from scrotum to scalp.</p>
<p>Marky Mark, took a trophy by severing what little flesh that held Sander's upper torso to the rest of his body, and is now dragging Sander's head and shoulders by the hand. Franz examined the body of the cleft guard, and discovers that he is the custodian of the sewers, the poo talker, two weeks from retiring, full pension and 401k funded, and now very dead on the streets of Bagnan. Franz took the custodian's keys as well as a sparkly button denoting the former poo talker's station. He also recalled that there is some discord amongst the Festering Scar: not everyone is on board with Steve the Crime Bosses' recent advances on Lord Marsten.</p>
<p>The Bunch enters the sewers, and Madonna quickly senses an intelligence somewhere in the depths. Liliana gets caught staring at Madonna's boobs, and quickly quips that she was just worried about the wound she has taken. Liliana then began singing to Madonna's breasts while massaging them for "healing reasons" which is totally a bard thing. The song was successful, but attracted the attention of the sewer intelligence: the fecal hivemind.</p>
<p>Madonna sensed a coalescing of poop slimes which began speaking in a language only Madonna knew, the fart language (blame Becky). She was able to convince the hivemind that the Funky Bunch only wanted to collect Keeva and be on their way. The grand poohbah (thanks Marella) offered a deal to the group: kill any Festering Scar here, and the sewers will guide them to Keeva safely. Madonna reports that the poo really just wants to be left alone, and all of the Scar activity has upset the sewer.</p>
<p>The group continues on through the sewers, sludge pools leading them deeper into darkness.</p>
<p>Oh, and Liliana sung a song to heal Marky Mark's butt wound, but for some reason didn't have a need to massage him. Seems...suspicious</p>
<hr>
<p>The filth elemental leads the funky bunch to a room filled with unsuspecting Scar. Liliana began a beautiful song to strengthen the group, and while successful, the Scar on the other side barricade the door to prevent unwanted interruption. Franz thinks cleverly, though. Knowing that shit patrol is a lonely one, he offers up a sexy dance from naked Madonna. It works, and they open the door, but quickly realize it is a trap after Franz threatens them directly, believing this is all a test from Steve.</p>

<p>But, Franz realizes that he has become the custodian of the sewers and has the keys to prove it, at least after Shiela pointed it out. Liliana surmises the correct key and the group bursts into the room to find a disturbed poker game, and four very annoyed Scar guards. Franz points at Karl, the cheating rotten bastard Scar guard, and tells the rest of the guards that Karl is hiding Aces!</p>

<p>Karl, not willing to let a 10 silver pot go to the honest winner, stabs and kills his best friend Friendo. Marky Mark rushes into the party, but stumbles over Franz's noble feet and gets hurt in the pride parts and leaves in a huff. Madonna kicks Eugene, another of the guards, squarely in the junk, but realizes too late that he was a eunuch and the blow wasn't nearly as effective as hoped. Liliana takes aim and squarely puts an arrow where Madonna's foot was just moments before.</p>

<p>Karl takes another stab at his former friends, but misses, allowing fellow guard Steven to feint and nick Karl's femoral artery. Madonna puts another arrow into Eugene and the eunuch isn't looking too good.</p>

<p>Sheila walks up to Steven, and successfully applies a needle full of Goldenroot to convince him that they're all on the same side. It works, and Steven allows the group to gain access to the deeper tunnels. Franz looks again at the table, and reveals that Karl was actually just holding a 4, and not an Ace. Marky Mark wants to gimp the eunuch, but the warrior's pride convinces him to just finish the man's life. MM slits Eugene's throat and pulls his soul into his body (or at least he thinks it's Eugene's soul).</p>
<hr id="latest">
<p>Liliana digs through the bodies and finds a handful of coin as well as a peasant wedding ring which she give to Franz. Marky Mark, ready for action, shoulders his way through the northern door revealing a room with a stone obelisk adorned with runes and pretty stones that seems to be cleansing the area of sludge. Madonna blinked in and out of visibility and approached the oblelisk ignoring and dodging Liliana's attempts to stop her. Liliana recalled a story about a former companion, a dwarf named Mick the Knife, who ignored a magical ward on a treasure chest resulting in the dwarf shrinking down to two inches tall upon opening it.</p>

<p>Shiela believes her study of the runes will result in the ability to craft a poison that will also cause shrinkage, but she is very, very wrong. MM, tired again from the hemming and hawing of not destroying things moves to push the obelisk down, but it is too firmly attached to the ground to budge. The last remaining Scar guard Steven parleys release from the party, and the angered Marky Mark convinces Steven that the fastest way out is actually to go deeper into the sewer. Steven claps MM on the shoulder as he thanks him for the advice. As Steve steps into the next room, the flagstone collapses completely and he falls to a very pointy death on spikes below, splattering Madonna with blood. Franz suggests using the bodies of the other Scar guards to clog the trap and proceed. Shiela suggests using a rope, but Franz will have none of it (until Liliana suggests the same thing). Shiela ties a rope around her waist and leaps over the pit. Her jump is just short though, and she lands ribs first on the opposite side. Shiela uses some found wooden planks to fashion a bridge for the rest of the group.</p>

<p>Madonna listens intently, and begins to hear music emanating from rubble in the eastern wall. MM begins hauling stone to make a path after Shiela gives a quick check for traps. As MM creates a way through, the music becomes louder and clearer. Liliana smells a rush of stale, dead air. Madonna sends in her owl, and the music stops. The owl does not return. Shiela squeezes through, but her hand catches a loose stone sending her lamp crashing to the ground, but she is compelled to continue toward the music. Liliana now recognizes the music as the songs damned spirits unable to pay the ferryman must play while begging for coins to cross over into the afterlife. Franz pushes through, and finds himself humming along with the tune.</p>

<p>MM clears more rubble making it easier for the rest of the group to get through the tunnel. Liliana makes it through the with the lamp and finds several spirits busking, and while they are weakened from possibly centuries of being trapped on the mortal plane they are growing hungry and enraged. Liliana confirms that the spirits are in need of 32 pieces of silver, 2 each, in order to pass on. Shiela provides the coin if they perform the service of clearing the tunnel of all remaining Scar. They agree, and with evil grins the spectres turn into horrifying creatures: like the eyeball hands guy from Pan's Labrynth crossed with Edward Penis-hands, with a vertical vagina mouth (Damon).</p>

<p>Ghosts rush out, and split the party. Everywhere the spirits encounter Scar, they tear them apart with ease. The paths of the sewer tunnels converge and the party sees the ghosts attacking the final Scar members, including Keeva...</p>
