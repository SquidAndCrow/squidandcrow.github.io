        <h1>The Story So Far</h1>
        <p>The Funky Bunch arrived in Bagnan in search of Prince Franz' precious family necklace. They paid for rooms at the Randy Giraffe and began their search.</p>
        <p>Shiela, who had stolen Prince Franz' necklace made haste to a the Rusty Copper—a pawn shop owned by Keeva—and convinced her to hold onto the necklace with the promise that she would be given a portion of its eventual sale. She agreed.</p>
        <p>During this, the rest of the party met Loranna, a scribe, and attempted to hire her to make some Lost Necklace posters for Prince Franz. Her door was locked, but that was no match for the Funky Bunch who broke in anyway. They saw that Loranna was performing forgery services for none other than Steve the Crime Boss.</p>
        <p>They were given a price (that no one could afford since everyone's broke as fuck), and separated to look around the city for more information.</p>
        <p>Liliana spoke with Barto, the owner of the Randy Giraffe, and he offered her enough money to pay for the Lost Necklace posters if she would get herself hired at the rival tavern, The Snuggly Ostritch, and sing a song promoting the Randy Giraffe. She agreed, returned with a writ of performance from Captain Sven, and prepared to go on stage that night.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the party found their way to the Rusty Copper in search of the necklace. Feeling the heat, Shiela changed the deal with Keeva, telling her to immediately pawn the necklace to Prince Franz. Having been told of its value, and knowing she now had a prince over a barrel, she offered the necklace to the party for 10,000 gold pieces.</p>
        <p>The party negotiated, and Keeva gave them an opportunity to retreive a ledger containing evidence of Steve the Crime Lord's misdeeds in the possession of Lord Marsten. The party agreed that they would take this course of action.</p>
        <p>Liliana, Shiela and Marky Mark came up with an executed a plan to get Captain Sven out of the picture during Liliana's song, knowing that the bar owner would never let the party out alive after the kind of song she had planned. Marky Mark would charm his way into the Snuggly Ostritch's chef's pants giving Shiela an opportunity to dose Captain Sven's dinner with sleeping poison</p>
        <p>Madonna and Prince Franz said "fuck it" and broke into the Rusty Copper that night and stole the necklace back while Liliana performed .</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The plan worked, and with Sven knocked out Liliana performed her advertisement for the Randy Giraffe. The crowd turned on her quickly, throwing beer steins, chairs, glitter bombs, and anything else they could. With the protective forcefield around the stage failing, she cashed in her favor with Shiela giving the rogue a passionate kiss winning the crowd back. Liliana caught sight of Loranna rushing clumsily out of the tavern.</p>
        <p>Prince Franz, Madonna and Marky Mark were hanging out near the entrance of the Snuggly Ostritch when Loranna came out and asked Marky Mark to escort her through the streets of Bagnan to her home in the residential district. He agreed and the two left; followed "deftly" behind by everyone else in the party, convinced that Marky Mark was up to some skeez.</p>
        <p>After winding Marky Mark through the city in the hopes that he wouldn't remember how to get to his house, she offered him a drink back at her place only to have Liliana rush up and start fangirling Loranna giving Shiela the opportunity to knock out and kidnap Loranna to use her as leverage against Steve the Crime Boss</p>
        <p>Understandably pissed off at the group, Marky Mark hefted Loranna over his shoulder and ran her back through the city away from the group, but right into an ambush of Steve the Crime Boss' men. Marky Mark dispatched one of them, but was so distracted by the ambush, that Madonna snuck in and picked up Loranna's unconscious body whisking her away from the fight. The rest of the party caught up to Marky Mark, and Prince Franz landed a savage blow on the remaining rogue, but not before he blew a signal whistle alerting the entire area that something was wrong.</p>
        <p>As Madonna rushed through the city streets as guided by her owl, Loranna whispered to her "Please help me, you have to get me away from Steve the Crime Lord". Madonna lead Loranna out of the city to a waterfall grotto, then sent her owl back with a note for the party letting them know where she was going to be.</p>
        <p>The party left at in the alley with the dead thugs scattered, except for Marky Mark who was determined to get something out of the night's adventure. As he looted the corpses, five thieves came out of the shadows and surrounded him. Marky Mark summoned some good vibrations and dispatched all five enemies by hurling blades into their foreheads. After a quick loot, Marky Mark ran, catching up with the rest of the party who'd regrouped at the Randy Giraffe where they received Madonna's note.</p>
        <p>Barto told the group that he'd cover for them as they escaped, knowing that the Festering Scar would be on them if they waited around. The party Bagnon, and met up with Madonna and Loranna where Loranna told them that Steve the Crime Boss was forcing her and her sister Keeva to perform underhanded services for the crime syndicate using their parents lives as leverage. The party now has a decision to make whether or not they want to help the scribe and her family, or get the hell out of the area.</p>
        <p>Oh, and Marky Mark's penis has been massively erect for at least four hours</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The group conversed with Loranna, and she convinced them to save her family while she waited at the grotto. Marky Mark earned a new verse by quieting his erection on a nearby, mossy tree.</p>
        <p>In order to reenter the town, Madonna suggested that the group contact her friend Dexter: a seamstress who lives on the outskirts of Bagnan. Dexter was delighted that Madonna was finally willing to let him dress her, even if it was in peasant clothes. The group planned to enter the town as textile sellers wearing the peasant sarapes Dexter prepared.</p>
        <p>As they entered the town, they saw a band of well-oiled strapping young men lead by Captain Sven of the Snuggly Ostritch rushing directly to the Randy Giraffe. The band of Glitter Boys split up and began nailing all of the tavern's entrances shut. The Funky Bunch ran to the rear and dispatched the gang, but not before Captain Sven ordered flaming bombs be thrown into the Randy Giraffe.</p>
        <p>Marky Mark rushed dick first into the back door and Shiela made her way in to save the trapped patrons. She's able to convince Barto to leave his office, but while he was distracted she grabbed proof that Barto didn't even own the bar in the first place!.</p>
        <p>Barto escapes the bar, and presents the group with a bottle of La Virgen Roja, an amazingly well-crafted and respected run from the Virgen Islands and heads off, while Sven and the Glitter Boys return to the Ostritch. The party did not walk away completely unscathed though: Prince Franz has suffered what is apparently a mortal wound.</p>
  <hr id="latest">
  <p>The Funky Bunch surveyed the city, and saw that the commons were being ransacked by the Festering Scar. Shiela noticed that their efforts, while seemingly random and chaotic, were actually clever ruses to allow for the Scar to focus getting their people into their buildings and smuggling criminal stuff out</p>
  <p>The party didn't hesitate, and wanting to both rescue Loranna's family and collect some dirt on Steve the Crime boss, they split up: Sheila and Franz headed toward Lord Marsten's manor, while Lilianna, Madonna and Marky Mark made their way toward Loranna's home.</p>
  <p>Shiela was able to help she and Franz get past the city guard blockades, and when that failed, Franz was able to use his nobility and charm to convince the guards that they were guests of Lord Marsten and they had an appointment to see him. The guards granted them access to the noble quarter without further delay.</p>
  <p>Marky Mark, Lilianna and Madonna fought their way toward Loranna's home. Madonna shot two of them deftly, while Liliana sang the ballad of Marky Mark to bolster his strength. Marky Mark snapped the neck of one of the rogues, but not before he was able to bury a blade into Lilianna's shoulder. Enraged, Marky Mark lept at the thief, crotch-to-face, and snapped his neck between two powerful thighs. Madonna dispatched the third brgand and they were left to enter Loranna's home, finding the music box they'll be using to convince Keeva and her parents that the Funky Bunch is to be trusted.</p>
  <p>Franz and Shiela had less luck. After failing to convince Lord Marsten's butler that they have business with Lord Marsten, the pair break into the manor via first floor window, situated directly above the Marsten matriarch's urn and ashes. Having shattered both the urn and table the urn was resting on by stumbling through the window, they were confronted by a maid and butler very displeased to see them.</p>
  <p>The pair discovered Lord Marsten only hires former martial artists, and their attempts to attack the waitstaff left them disarmed and disadvantaged. Prince Franz was having nothing of this, and stood against Shiela in support of the peasants. Thinking quickly, Shiela recalled that Lord Marsten treats his staff like garbage, and was able to convince the staff to let them gain access to the house after convincing the maid and butler that she and Franz were starting a people's revolution; uncovering corrupution and bringing the rich to justice using Barto's forged deed as leverage.</p>
